# Comprehensive Branding Analysis Report
## Taliman (تلیمان) — Website Development Reference

---

## 1. Brand Foundation

### Company Overview & Brand Essence

**Company Name:** Taliman (تلیمان)
**Full Name:** Taliman — Sakhtehaye Felezi Kara (ساخته‌های فلزی کارا)
**Translation:** Taliman — Efficient Metal Structures/Products

**Industry:** Metal processing and manufacturing, specializing in annealing operations — the softening and spheroidization of metal molecular structures.

**Brand Essence:** The Taliman brand embodies the fusion of ancient Persian craftsmanship heritage with modern technical precision. The visual identity draws direct inspiration from 10th-century Samarkand pottery patterns, symbolizing the transformation of rigid metal into soft, malleable forms through sophisticated metallurgical processes.

### Brand Story & Symbolism

The logo concept is rooted in Iranian cultural identity, specifically derived from geometric and floral motifs found on Central Asian Samarkand pottery (referenced from Christie's collection). This heritage connection serves multiple purposes: the interwoven circular lines represent soft, malleable, wire-like metal elements; the circular/spherical forms symbolize the spheroidized molecular structure achieved through annealing; and the geometric precision conveys technical expertise and engineering excellence.

### Brand Personality & Voice Characteristics

Based on the visual identity system, Taliman's brand personality projects precision-driven craftsmanship with deep cultural heritage, technical authority balanced with artistic sensibility, and reliability through geometric consistency. The brand voice should be professional and technically competent, confident without being boastful, and heritage-conscious while maintaining a forward-thinking perspective.

### Target Audience Profile

The brand positioning suggests the primary audience consists of industrial clients and B2B partners in the metal manufacturing sector, engineering professionals and procurement specialists, and businesses requiring specialized metal treatment services. A secondary audience includes potential employees and industry partners.

## 2. Visual Identity System

### Logo Specifications

**Logo Components:**

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Symbol (Logomark)** | Four interlocked circular motifs with internal petal/leaf shapes, forming a unified square composition |
| **Persian Logotype** | Custom geometric Persian typography: تلیمان |
| **English Logotype** | Custom geometric Latin typography: Taliman |
| **Tagline** | Persian: ساخته‌های فلزی کارا / English: Sakhtehaye Felezi Kara |

**Design Characteristics:**
The logo is designed flat (no gradients or dimensionality), uses uniform stroke thickness throughout, is built on a precise geometric grid system, and works equally well in black/white and color applications.

**Logo Configurations:**

| Configuration | Use Case |
|---------------|----------|
| Horizontal (Symbol + Wordmark) | Primary configuration for most applications |
| Stacked (Symbol above bilingual wordmarks) | Square format applications |
| Symbol only | Favicon, app icons, small applications |
| Wordmark only | Text-heavy environments where symbol is impractical |

**Clear Space Requirements:**
Minimum clear space = X (where X equals the height of the lowercase letters in the logotype). This space must be maintained on all four sides of the logo in any configuration.

## 3. Brand Application Guidelines

### Layout & Composition Principles

The brand emphasizes geometric precision and balance, clean layouts with generous whitespace, grid-based composition reflecting the logo's construction, and bilateral symmetry where appropriate (reflecting the logo's structure).

### Logo Usage Rules — DO's ✓

- Use approved color combinations (purple on light, white/light on purple, black on white, white on black)
- Maintain minimum clear space
- Scale proportionally
- Use on solid, neutral backgrounds

### Logo Usage Rules — DON'Ts ✗

| Prohibition | Rationale |
|-------------|-----------|
| No rotation | Destroys geometric balance |
| No distortion/skewing | Compromises precision |
| No miscellaneous colors | Off-brand appearance |
| No transparency changes | Weakens brand presence |
| No effects (shadows, glows, etc.) | Contradicts flat design philosophy |
| No outline/stroke-only versions | Logo loses impact |
| No borders/frames around logo | Creates visual clutter |
| No use on busy/colored backgrounds | Reduces legibility |

### Approved Background Treatments

| Logo Version | Background |
|--------------|------------|
| Full color (purple) | White, off-white, light gray |
| White/reversed | Deep purple, black, dark gray |
| Black | White, off-white, light gray |

```

### Imagery Guidelines for Web

**Photography Style:**
Based on the brand's industrial focus and heritage elements, imagery should feature industrial/manufacturing environments with clean, professional lighting, close-up details of metal textures and processes, warm color grading (avoiding cold/clinical blue tones), and high contrast with rich shadows.

**Image Treatment:**
Apply subtle warm color overlay to maintain palette consistency, avoid overly saturated or artificial coloring, and consider duotone treatments using brand purples for hero images (used sparingly per CEO preference).

### Overall Aesthetic Direction

**Design Philosophy:**
The website should embody *"Technical Heritage"* — a balance of precise, modern functionality with warm, culturally-rooted aesthetics.

**Key Design Principles:**

| Principle | Implementation |
|-----------|----------------|
| Geometric precision | Grid-based layouts, consistent spacing, aligned elements |
| Warm neutrality | Off-white backgrounds, warm grays, minimal pure whites |
| Strategic color | Purple as accent only — navigation highlights, CTAs, key links |
| Clean simplicity | Flat design, no unnecessary gradients or effects |
| Cultural connection | Subtle geometric patterns inspired by the logo's heritage |

**Suggested UI Elements:**

| Element | Treatment |
|---------|-----------|
| Navigation | Clean, minimal — logo left, links right, subtle gray divider |
| Buttons | Rounded corners (4–8px), solid purple primary, outlined secondary |
| Cards | Subtle warm shadow, off-white background, no borders |
| Dividers | Thin light gray lines (`#E5E5E5`) or spacing only |
| Icons | Line-style icons in medium gray, matching logo stroke weight |

## Technical Implementation Strategy

### Component Architecture
```
App Layout
├── Header (Navigation + Language Switcher)
├── Main Content
│   ├── HeroSection
│   ├── AboutSection
│   ├── ProcessesSection
│   ├── EquipmentSection
│   ├── QualitySection
│   └── ContactSection
└── Footer
```

### Data Flow
1. **Static Content**: Stored in translation files (`messages/`)
2. **Dynamic Content**: Generated at build time (SSG)
3. **Form Data**: Client-side validation, future server submission

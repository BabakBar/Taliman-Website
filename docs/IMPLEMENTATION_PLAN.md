## 7. Astro-Specific Technical Implementation

### 7.1 Astro Development Standards

#### Essential Astro Integrations
```json
{
  "astro": "^5.0.0",
  "@astrojs/tailwind": "^5.1.2",
  "@astrojs/sitemap": "^3.2.1",
  "@astrojs/check": "^0.9.4",
  "@astrojs/typescript": "^1.7.1",
  "bun-types": "latest"
}
```

#### Astro Configuration Best Practices
```typescript
// astro.config.mjs
export default defineConfig({
  output: 'static',
  site: 'https://taliman.com',
  i18n: {
    defaultLocale: 'fa',
    locales: ['fa', 'en'],
    routing: {
      prefixDefaultLocale: false
    }
  },
  integrations: [
    tailwind(),
    sitemap({
      i18n: {
        defaultLocale: 'fa',
        locales: {
          fa: 'fa-IR',
          en: 'en-US'
        }
      }
    })
  ]
});
```

#### Performance Targets (Astro Optimized)
- **First Contentful Paint**: < 1.0s (Astro's zero-JS by default)
- **Largest Contentful Paint**: < 1.8s (optimized static generation)
- **Time to Interactive**: < 2.0s (minimal client-side JavaScript)
- **Lighthouse Scores**: 100/100 across all categories

### 7.2 Astro Testing & Validation Strategy

#### Content Collections Validation
```typescript

import { z, defineCollection } from 'astro:content';

const processesCollection = defineCollection({
  type: 'content',
  schema: z.object({
    title: z.string(),
    description: z.string(),
    specifications: z.array(z.string()),
    applications: z.array(z.string()),
    images: z.array(z.string()).optional()
  })
});

export const collections = {
  processes: processesCollection
};
```

#### Astro Build Testing
```bash
# TypeScript checking
bun astro check

# Build validation
bun astro build

# Preview production build
bun astro preview
```

  ]
});
```

## 8. Astro-Specific Risk Mitigation

### 8.1 Technical Risks

#### Content Collections Complexity
**Risk**: Complex content relationships and multilingual content management
**Mitigation**: 
- Start with simple content schemas and iterate
- Use Astro's built-in validation early in development
- Test content queries with real data from day one

#### Static Generation Performance
**Risk**: Slow build times with large amounts of content and images
**Mitigation**:
- Leverage Astro's incremental builds
- Optimize image processing pipeline
- Use Content Layer API efficiently

#### Server Islands Integration
**Risk**: Form functionality issues in static-first architecture
**Mitigation**:
- Thoroughly test Server Islands in development
- Implement proper fallbacks for JavaScript-disabled environments
- Use progressive enhancement principles

### 8.2 Content & Localization Risks

#### i18n Routing Complexity
**Risk**: URL structure and SEO issues with bilingual routing
**Mitigation**:
- Use Astro's built-in i18n routing from the start
- Test hreflang and canonical URL generation
- Validate sitemap generation for both languages

#### Content Schema Evolution
**Risk**: Changes to content structure during development
**Mitigation**:
- Design flexible content schemas with optional fields
- Use TypeScript for compile-time validation
- Implement gradual schema migration strategies

### 8.3 Performance & Deployment Risks

#### CDN and Caching Issues
**Risk**: Static asset delivery and cache invalidation problems
**Mitigation**:
- Test CDN configuration thoroughly in staging
- Implement proper cache headers and versioning
- Monitor asset delivery performance post-launch

#### Third-party Integration Limits
